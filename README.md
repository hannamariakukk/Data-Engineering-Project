Which datasets will we use? 

1.6 million UK traffic accidents, Kaggle, Dave Fisher-Hickey, https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/daveianhickey/2000-16-traffic-flow-england-scotland-wales/data?select=accidents_2012_to_2014.csv 

MIDAS OPEN: UK hourly weather observation data version 202407, CEDA Archive, Met Office, https://data.ceda.ac.uk/badc/ukmo-midas-open/data/uk-hourly-weather-obs/dataset-version-202407 

 

Which questions will we want to find an answer to? 

1. What is the weather and location for which the most number of accidents have happened? 

2. Do some roads/locations have less traffic accidents even on days when the weather is dangerous? 

3. Does wind speed impact traffic accidents and if so what is the threshold of dangerously too high speed of wind? 

4. Does the seasonal changes impact traffic accidents and if so then what is the most dangerous month?
